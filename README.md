# gmod-simpler-thirdperson
This is a addon I made a long time ago.

## Use

This addon aims to make the user of thirdperson simpler.

The way this addon is going to do this is by removing all user interaction with any menus and settings.

The user only have to click `F1` to change their view, this will go through a couple of thirdperson views and back to firstperson.
